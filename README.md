# EcoDrive+

EcoDrive+ is a pioneering initiative that promotes responsible driving by incentivizing users through a point-based system. As drivers navigate the roads, the app monitors their behavior, rewarding smooth rides and penalizing aggressive maneuvers. This not only ensures safer roads but also benefits the environment by encouraging fuel-efficient driving habits.


## Inspiration

In the evolving world of connected cars, premium automotive manufacturers have begun leveraging driving habits to determine insurance tariffs. We envisioned transcending this concept by not just monitoring but actively promoting good driving habits. By blending technology with gamification, we aspired to transform every smartphone into a tool for responsible driving.


## Tech Stack

Using **Flutter**, **Dart**, and Android Studio, we architected an intuitive app that harnesses the power of the smartphone's built-in accelerometer to detect driving patterns.
## Installation

run the **.apk** file provided in folder
## Challenges we ran into

Integrating the accelerometer functionality proved to be the most challenging aspect. The process of translating raw accelerometer readings into meaningful insights about a car's motion was intricate. Real-world testing posed another challenge since we lacked immediate access to a car.

## What We Learned

Beyond the nuances of app development, we learned the potential of motion-sensing technology in promoting sustainable behaviors. The project underlined the value of real-world testing and the challenges posed by its absence.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

Despite the hurdles, we successfully transformed a complex concept into a functional app, offering users a gamified platform to engage with responsible driving practices.
## What's Next for EcoDrive+

To scale EcoDrive+, our vision includes introducing new challenges and skill levels to boost user engagement. We are also conceptualizing a leaderboard system, amplifying the competitive spirit and fostering a community of responsible drivers. By partnering with automotive insurers, we also see potential in converting points to tangible rewards or discounts. The road ahead is promising!
